      <p/>
      BAMRU is an all-volunteer wilderness search and rescue (SAR) unit, based in the San Francisco Bay Area. We look for and help people lost or stranded anywhere outdoors in California.
      <p/>

      All of our funding comes from donations and member contributions, with some assistance from the San Mateo County Sheriff's Emergency Services Bureau primarily for fuel and ropes.  Substantially all of our expenditures go directly to fund searches, trainings, and support supplies and equipment.  We have no paid employees, consultants, contractors or agents - all of our members are volunteers who donate their own personal time, personal gear, and personal contributions.

      We are an accredited member of the Mountain Rescue Association and are a FEMA and California OES Type I search and rescue resource. This means that we have the ability to operate safely and effectively, night or day, in all terrain, in all weather, and in all seasons.


      <p/>

      Members of BAMRU are climbers, mountaineers, backpackers and skiers who train in a variety of skills used for wilderness search and rescue. BAMRU members live all over the Bay Area, from Marin to Santa Cruz and from San Francisco to Contra Costa County.

      <p/>

      The unit is an independent, tax-exempt public charity as described in IRS section 501(c) (3) (Federal ID 23-7098708).  It is a non-profit corporation with an elected board of directors, affiliated with the San Mateo County (California) Sheriff's Emergency Services Bureau.

      <p/>

      BAMRU is a member organization of the Mountain Rescue Association and the Bay Area Search and Rescue Council (BASARC).

      <p/>


      BAMRU members donate their time for training and emergency operations. No payment is expected for our services.  BAMRU has also sponsored three other teams in achieving their Mountain Rescue Association accreditations.

      <p/>

      BAMRU is also in need of replacing its aging rescue truck with a 3/4 ton or larger 4x4 pickup or 4x4 van, and greatly welcomes donations for its replacement, including a direct donation of a new or reliable and serviceable used vehicle meeting BAMRU's mission needs.
