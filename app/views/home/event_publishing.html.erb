<h1>About Event Publishing</h1>
On the BAMRU website, we publish a <a href="http://bamru.org/calendar" target="_blank">calendar</a> with all of our Meetings, Trainings, and Community Events.<p></p>
These events are also loaded into our Google calendar,
and we publish a summary of <a href="http://bamru.org/operations" target="_blank">BAMRU Operations</a>
on our website.<p></p>
Only 'published' events are distributed on our public websites.  You can change the 'published' status when you edit an event.<p></p>
Any member can create/edit/delete any event.  Edit with care!<p></p>
