<h1>How to Publish Events onto the BAMRU Website</h1>
On the BAMRU website (at <a href="http://bamru.org" target="_blank">http://bamru.org/calendar</a>),
we publish a <a href="http://bamru.org/calendar" target="_blank">calendar</a> with all
of our Meetings, Trainings, and Community Events.<p></p>

These events are also loaded into our
<a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=bamru.calendar%40gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles">Google calendar</a>,
and we publish a summary of <a href="http://bamru.org/operations" target="_blank">BAMRU Operations</a>
on our website.<p></p>
Only 'published' events are distributed to our public websites.  You can change the 'published' status when you edit an event.<p></p>
When you edit an event, it takes a minute or so for the changes to be reflected on the Google Calendar and on our public website.<p></p>
Any member can create/edit/delete any event.  Get started on the <a href="/events">Events</a> page, and edit with care!<p></p>
