# BAMRU.net Development Roadmap

## Top Bug Fixes

* message log page refresh resends page
* email gateway disconnects need to auto-restart
* long roster lists cause memory errors and slow responsiveness

## Near-Term Enhancements

* Add Configurable Roles
* Add Historical Reports

* Add validations to Event Reference forms

## UI Tweaks

* Make PDF rendering optional for Reference Links
* Add annotation for DO's in period

### RSVPs on Verizon and Sprint

Step 1 is to monitor / alert failing emails (underway).
Step 2 is to patch interactions with our current SMS gateway,
or switch to a new provider.

## Long-Term Direction

* Replace the Wiki software
* Multi-tenant support for SMCSAR, SCU and SMSO
* Responsive UI using Zurb Foundation
* PhoneGap wrapper & SmartPhone alarms
