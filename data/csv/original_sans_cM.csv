"244","Event","SMCSAR Preplan Exercise ","Butano State Park","The pre-planning exercises are designed to help us gather data on a park or open space in regards to terrain, vegetation, hazards, high-probability areas, command post logistics, and communications challenges.  As with our previous efforts at Sam McDonald Park and Russian Ridge OSP, this exercise will focus on using the same protocols that we would use on an actual search:  teams will be formed, given assignments, briefed and dispatched.  When those teams return, they will be debriefed for information about their assigned area, and GPS tracks and waypoints will be downloaded. In addition to the benefits we receive from our exposure to the parks, we also meet with the rangers that work these areas and develop relationships that will pay dividends when we respond to search emergencies.  While I was meeting with the Supervising Ranger for Butano, a 10 year old girl suffered a fall in the park and suffered a broken arm – radius and ulna fractures, with severe angulation.  She was only about a quarter of a mile from the campground, and the call was handled by CalFire and AMR with the Ranger and myself assisting.  But it was clear that if she had been much further away from the campground, it was exactly the kind of carryout that we would be engaged in.  ","2010-06-26","0000-00-00","Ethan Frantz"
